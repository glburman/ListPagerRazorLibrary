# ListPagerRazorLibrary

This a set of Asp Net Core 3.0 View Components, Partial Views with related statics (css/js), styled with Bootstrap 4 
and wrapped in a Razor Class Library. It provides UI, paging event triggering and related scripting and is agnostic
about the data source, sorting, etc. 

See the **ListPagerExamples** project for Ajax and non-Ajax usage.

### TL;DR

- Do the **Setup** section below

- Embed **ListPager** as a **Partial View** with
      <partial name="_ListPager" model="[ListPagerModel Instance]"/>
  or as a **View Component** with
      @await Component.InvokeAsync("ListPager", [ListPagerModel Instance])

- See the appropriate example in the **ListPagerExamples project** (Ajax or non-Ajax) on how to 
      
      - handle the resulting javascript 'Paging Events'
      
      - instantiate, initialize and pass an instance of the 'ListPagerModel' class

      - use the required 'ListPagerModel.CheckBoundaries()' method

### Setup

To use ListPager in your Asp.Net Core (3.0 or later) Web project :

- add a reference to the "ListPagerRazorLibrary" project.

- in the Host Project's "Startup.cs" add the following:

```    
      public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services, ...)
      {
        ...
        services.AddListPagerViews();
        ...
      }

      public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env, ....)
      {
        ...
        app.UseListPagerStatics();
        ...
      }
```

- in the host project's "\_ViewImports.cshtml" add these lines:

```
  @using ListPagerRazorLibrary
  @using ListPagerRazorLibrary.Models
  @using ListPagerRazorLibrary.ViewComponents
```

- include "css/pager.css" in the host project's "\_Layout.cshtml" page

- render ListPager in a host view like this:

```
  @model ListPagerModel
  @await Component.InvokeAsync(nameof(ListPagerRazorLibrary.ViewComponents.ListPager), Model)
  
  // OR
   
  @model ListPagerModel
  <partial name="_ListPager" model=@Model/>
```

- fallback ListPagerModel defaults are set in AppConstants.cs and ListPagerModel.cs 
  but you'll likely want to set your own initial values like this:

```
    public void OnGet(int PageNumber=1, int PageSize = 5)
    {
        //...
            PagerData.PageNumber = PageNumber;
            PagerData.PageSize = PageSize;
            PagerData.TotalRecords = _db.Set<MyDataType>().Count();
            
            /*********************************
             * Important !
             * must do this to set PageCount
            **********************************/
            PagerData.CheckBoundaries();  

    }
```

### Scripting

The library includes the static resource "Pager.js" (< 2 kb) which exports the default class 'Pager'. It must be Imported as a module.
Please refer to the "ListPagerExamples" project for use in various cases.


### Customizing

- There are several ways to customize ListPager. In summary, you can :

      - Use the visibility 'toggles' and other settings available in the provided 'ListPagerModel' c# Class (see below)
      
      - Override a sub-view (e.g. 'ListPagerPageOf.cshtml') by adding your own version in the correct folder (see below)
      
      - Override the CSS in 'wwwroot/css/pager.css' and/or include your own .css file
      
      - Change the pager layout/ structure by using your own container View, ignoring or overriding ListPager.cshtml / _ListPager.cshtml
      
- Any view (See 'Included Views' below) in a Razor Class Library can be overridden by the host, as can the .css
     
      At this writing RCL overrides require that the host folder structure mirror the library. ListPagerRazorLibrary has the following relevant structure:

      css/pager.css           (below wwwroot in the host)
      js/pager.js             (might be better to fork the project than override this)
      Pages/Shared            (only _ListPager.cshtml, the Partial View version, lives here)
      Pages/Shared/Components (ListPager.cshtml and all the other Component Views)

- Layout changes can by done by 

      - Overridding Listpager.cshtml or _ListPager.cshtml, or using your own container View instead.

      - Using the ListPager 'sub-views' and/or your own views/content in the HTML structure you wish
      

- Component/*.cshtml can be used as Partial Views like this example for "ListPagerLinks.cshtml":
```
      <partial name="Components/ListPagerLinks.cshtml" model="[ModelInstance]" />
                  
      /* Note - ListPagerArrows and ListPagerDropdown require instances of their own Models,
      *  ListPagerArrowModel and ListPagerDropDownModel, and are therefore perhaps best 
      *  invoked as ViewComponents. All others require a ListPagerModel instance which
      *  is typically passed to the container ListPager.cstml or _ListPager.cshtml
      *  See _ListPager.cshtml and ListPager.cshtml for example usage.
      */
```

- folder names are case-sensitive for override purposes. "/CSS" or "/Css" is not the same as "/css"

### Included Views


Views are provided for each major element of the pager. All can be used as **View Components or Partial Views**.
        
- **ListPagerArrows**
    
      Backward and Forward single and double arrows
          
      Note - reqires an instance of ListPagerArrowModel which is automatically instantiated
      when Invoked as a View Component but must be manually instantiated when used as a
      Partial View.

- **ListPagerPageOf**

      The typical 'Page N of T' display
      Toggle with 'ListPagerModel.ShowPageOf''

- **ListPagerLinks**

      A series of N linked page numbers
      ListPagerModel.MaxPageLinks determines maximum N to be displayed

- **ListPagerRecords**

      A 'N of T records' display, suitable for filtered data sets 
      Toggle with ListPagerModel.ShowRecordsOf and typically ListPagerModel.IsFiltered

- **ListPagerDropdown**
    
      A configurable drop-down menu of incremental page jumps
      Toggle with "ListPagerModel.ShowDropDown"
      "ListPagerModel.DropDownIncrement" determines generated jump increments
        
      Note - reqires an instance of ListPagerDropdownModel which is automatically instantiated
      when Invoked as a View Component but must be manually instantiated when used as a
      Partial View.

- **ListPagerPageSize**

      A page-size UI element to allow user-setting of ListPagerModel.PageSize
      Toggle with "ListPagerModel.ShowPageSize"

- **ListPagerPostForm**

      For convenience in POST scenarios

**ListPager** itself comes in two flavours both of which can be overridden, or ignored, typically to change Layout:

- **ListPager**

      lives at Pages/Shared/Components/ListPager.cshtml and uses the above sub-views as View Components 

- **_ListPager**
      lives at Pages/Shared/_ListPager.cshtml and uses the above sub-views as Partial Views

### ListPagerModel

The **ListPagerModel** class (ListPagerModel.cs) provides the following method and properties:

- CheckBoundaries()
       The only method in the class, it is importantly responsible for checking/setting 
       page boundaries and ListPagerModel.PageCount
       
       There is intentionally no other setter for ListPagerModel.PageCount as it is 
       imperative that you call this prior to returning data or a view.

- PageCount 
       No public setter, this can only be set by calling the "CheckBoundaries()" method 

- PageNumber 
       Always ask "pager.js" to set this, via client Pager State, with "pager.goToPage(N)" which 
       fires a paging event. The "pager.setActivePage(N)" pager method is pure UI update, no paging 
       event is issued and it may be deprecated in a future version.

- MaxPageLinks 
       Maximum number of page-numbered links in the "ListPagerLinks" view

- TotalRecords
       Total unfiltered records in the dataset, as in: "mySet.Count()"
       CheckBoundaries() will set this to '0' if you leave it null

- FilteredRecordCount 
       Defaults to TotalRecordCount if null. It impacts the IsFiltered flag which is typically
       used to determine ListPagerModel.ShowRecordsOf state (i.e. toggle the ListPagerRecords view)

- PageSize
       Rows per page, see the "ListPagerPageSize" view and "ListPagerModel.ShowPageSize" toggle property.

- MaxPageSize
       Maximum value for the Page Size ui input, enforced by the "ListPagerModel.PageSize" setter.

- MinPageSize
       Minimum value for the Page Size ui input, enforced by the "ListPagerModel.PageSize" setter.

- PageSizeInputId 
       DOM id of the Page Size input box living in the "ListPagerPageSize" view

- PostTarget
       The URL target to POST "ListPagerPostForm" to, not required if you are not using that form
       
- DropDownIncrement
       The increment between page number links in the "ListPagerDropdown" view
       
- ShowPageOf
       Toggle "ListPagerPageOf" display

- ShowDropDown
       Toggle "ListPagerDropdown" display

- ShowRecordsOf
       Toggle "ListPagerRecords" display

- ShowPageSize
       Toggle "ListPagerPageSize" display

- IsFiltered 
       No setter - Getter returns a comparison of the "ListPagerModel.TotalRecords" and 
       "ListPagerModel.FilteredRecordCoount" property values

and for convenience, if you are providing a single column sort, you can carry the state in ListPagerModel

- SortDirection

- SortColumn




### Styling

The RCL includes the static resource "pager.css" which provides default Bootstrap 4 styling. 
ListPager also assigns some of its own class names:

- li.page-item
- li.page-item.disabled
- li.page-item.pager-range
- a.page-link
- a.page-link.disabled
- span.pager-page
- span.pager-dropdown
